# DEFCON29Badge and SAO
==========================================================
MAKEITHACKIN BADGE CTF INFORMATION WILL BE UPDATED HERE ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 7 AND ON TWITTER
==========================================================

I'll update this readme as time goes on, but yeah... this is my first official MakeItHackin unoffical DEF CON badge.

Badges will feature an ATTiny85 Microcontroller, OLED Display, RGB LEDs, and a SAO connector for all your shitty add-ons.

They will also include two security tags (applied in those blank spots).  One is for Checkpoint systems (8.2 MHz) and one is for Sensormatic systems (58 kHz).  Take your badge into any retail store and set off their alarms!  (just kidding, don't do that.)

It was difficult to think of a shape for the outline and I wanted to get them ordered ASAP, so I made the badge in the shape of a credit card to relate to the retail security theme.  

I'm going to make 25 of them.  Woo hoo!  

Also making 25 SAOs.  They will have 4 Neopixels, a Power LED, and a controllable LED.
